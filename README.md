ABR projects
============

This repository contains files for different projects in branches.
Since projects might organize things in several branches,
branches should be named

  `project/branch`

The main branch of each project should be

  `project/master`

So, for example, the main branch for the APC project is `apc/master`.

----

See the main branch of your project of interest
for more information on how to get started.
